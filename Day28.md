#### Day 28.
#### Yesterday I have learned how to get the number of stars from the given rating. Now I have to create the array for half star, full star and empty star. Before that I get to know about fill(). The fill() method is used to fill the array with a specific value, replacing all or some of the elements in the array. This is used to modify the original array. 
```js
return {
  fullstars: new Array(star).fill('full'),
  halfstar: new Array(halfStar).fill('half'),
  emptystar: new Array(emptyStar).fill('empty')
}; 
```
#### Here I have created a new array to store the star valve and fill it with (‘full’). Then created a new array of value half star and fill the array with (‘half’) and it contains o or 1. Similarly for empty star to hold the value of empty. Here if the rate is 2.5 the value of star will be 2, so the array will be filled with fullStar: [ ‘full’, ‘full’ ], the value of half star is 1 so it will have array filled with halfstar: [ ‘half’ ]. Then the empty value will be 2, the new array will be filled with emptystar ; [ ‘empty’, ’empty’ ].  
#### To print the star by HTML, I used for loop to loop over each element in the full star, half star and empty star array. For each loop it will a create a new <img> element. starCalc(users.rating.rate) function is used to call that processes the rating (users.rating.rate) and returns an object with arrays of stars.
#### Then I have learned about how to filter the products based on the category from the data fetched from an API. First created a array to store the fetched product data as product: product [] = [], then created another array to store the  filtered product data. Then created a function fetchData(), this method fetches the product from the services. I have created a getData () function in my service. Calls the getData() method of the injected service, which returns an Observable of Product[]. This observable is then assigned to the this.value property. Then I subscribe to the observable where the actual data handling is occurred when the data is emitted. Then changed the type of data to array. Then initialized the filteredProduct array with all the products. Then created a getProduct () method to extract the categories. 
#### Used for loop to iterates through each product in the this.product array.  if (!this.categories.includes(product.category) checks the category is already exits in the category are not. If the category is not in the array already, its added to the array by the push method. The push method is used in to add one or more elements to the end of an array. It modifies the original array and returns the new length of the array. Then we need to create a function to categorize the products based on the category we filtered above. Filtered (category : string ) method filters the products based on the selected category. Then created if class to check the category is provided to not. If it is we use filter method to filters the this.product array to include only products with the matching category. If there is no category provided then we set the filtered product = this.product it set to the original array and used to show all the products. 
#### To show the products category wise in HTML I have created a container and used flex to arrange the button in a row and added styling for that. Then I created a button tag to show all the elements by clicking the filtered(). (click)="filtered('')": When clicked, it calls the filtered('') method in the component's TypeScript. The empty string '' is passed as the category, which effectively removes any filter. Then created another button tag inside the container to display all the category. I used *ngFor directive iterates through the categories array in the component's TypeScript. For each category, it creates a button. (click)="filtered(category)": When a category button is clicked, it calls the filtered(category) method in the component's TypeScript, passing the clicked category as an argument. I used {{category}} to display the category name as the button’s text. 
#### The categories Array in the component holds unique category name and it is done by the getProduct() method. Filtered (category: String)  this method is called when the category button is clicked. If the category is empty, it sets all products to this.filteredProduct. If the category has a value, it filters the this.product array to get only products that matches the category and assigns the result to the this.filteredProduct. The *ngFor loop in the HTML (<div *ngFor="let users of filteredProduct">) iterates through the filteredProduct array. This ensures that only the filtered products are displayed.
#### We had a session with Koushik anna. I learned about async and await. With the example anna told, task 1 : buy groceries task2: arrange groceries tak3: put cloths to laundry task4: put cloths to dry task 5: fold the clothes. We can’t dry the clothes until they’ve actually been put in the laundry similarly cannot arrange groceries until we buy the groceries. In this situation the callback function is used to call it in order. The “put clothes to dry” task would be a callback that only runs after the “put clothes to laundry” task is done. The function are chained one after the another. If we have like 100 tasks it is hard to write call Back function for all the task and hard to read the code. So then came up with Promises. Promises helps us to do asynchronous function easier by chaining the task together by .then(). Here each task waits for the previous one to finish before it starts. Similarly If I have 1000 of task, I need to write more .then() to run all the function, then they came up with another solution called async and await. In Dart it is called as futures. We need to give the keyword async before the function to make it understand it as asynchronous function. We can loop the task using For loops and await makes each task run one by one. In our example we can have it like
```js
await buyGroceries();
  await putClothesToLaundry(); 
  await putClothesToDry();
  await arrangeGroceries();
  await foldClothes();
} 
```
#### Today, I learned about How to filter it by category wise and also  about the asynchronous functions and all the methods they used to make the code work with asynchronous function. 
#### Thank You.
