#### Day 35.
#### Today I learned how to create endpoint. First we need to create a project folder using command mkdir hello – apin, cd hello – api and initialize the node.js using npm init -y, it creates a pakage.json file which keeps track of our code. Install express using npm install express. Then create a file and name it to write our code. Then run the server node [filename]. 
#### Express.js is a web application framework for node.js that make its easier to build web servers and API’s. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant. The customer come in and make request like ordering food. the kitchen (server) prepares the food. The waiter (express.js ) takes the request to the kitchen and take back the response means food. So, Express.js helps the website understand what the user wants and send back the right response. Thus it makes building APIs with node.js easier.
#### Then I learned how to create three end points GET, POST and DELETE. I have created a folder called to-do and initialized node.js and installed express.js. Created file named server.js. Imported the express and creates an instance of an express application. The instance name as app and this app will be used to define our route and handle request and response. Then created a JSON object that have details of the to-dos and has two properties such as id and title. 
```js
app.get('/todos',(req, res)=>{
res.json(todos)}); 
```
#### app.get ( ‘/todos’ ) sets up a route to handle get request to /todos. ( res, req ) => { …. } this is the function that runs when someone visits the page. Req – the request what the user is asking for and res – the response what the server sends back. Res.json (todos) this sends back the list of todos as JSON. Then created a post request to add the new id and title. We set up a route to handle POST request to /todos. When a request come in it takes the title from the request body what the user gives, creates a object with a unique id by adding 1 to the current number of objects and adds this new item to the existing list. After adding the server send the response with a newly created item and a status code of 201 which means created.
#### Similarly for DELETE request, to delete a specific item based on the id. When the request is made, the server gets the id and converts in to a number. It creates a new list. If the new list has the same length as original list that means nothing was removed. So the server responds with 404 error. If a list was removed, it updates the original list and send back a message confirming that a ist with that id was deleted successfully. app.listen(PORT, () { … });  This line will tell the app to start listening for incoming request on the Port, without this the server will not run at all. Then tested it using Postman. 
#### Postman is a tool that helps us to test APIs, like talking to server without build a full website. If the user want to see the complete todo. Send a GET request. We use this to check if the server or API works. To check the response of the end point by sending request. It is like a messenger that helps us to send and receive message from our server for testing. 
#### Then learned about JWT. Its stands for JSON web token. It is a standard used for transmitting between partners as a JSON object. It has a specific structure separated by (.) header, payload, signature. Header tells what type of token and algorithm is used, payload contains the actual data like user information and signature is like security seal, made with secret key to make it safe. It is like a digital id when someone logs into out app, you give them the id ( token ). They show this id whenever they make request so, the app knows who they are. This works like this, when we login and create token with a secret key only we know that is JWT. Use token to access protected stuff: they sent request like authorization : bearer <token>. Server checks the token and the signature. If it is valid and not expired access will be granted, if it is fake or expired the access will be deined. 
#### Then I learned about what is authorization and authentication. Authentication is process of verifying a users identity, it is like who is accessing it. It confirm that a user is who they claim to be. Authorization is the process of determining what the user is allowed to access. Once the user is authenticated, the system checks their permission and tells for what all sources they can access. 
#### Then learned about hashing, it used in creating the signature part of JWT. Hashing enhances the password storage by adding a random string (the salt ) to each password before hashing. Bcrypt is a special tool that helps protect passwords by turning them into a secret code called hashes that are very hard to reverse. It always a random salt, it is like a extra piece added to the password before it is turned into a secret code. 
#### Today was a productive day as I learned how to create API endpoints using Express.js. I understood how to set up a project, install dependencies, and build routes for GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I also explored tools like Postman for testing APIs, learned about JWT for secure authentication, and understood key concepts like authorization, authentication, and hashing with bcrypt. These topics helped me gain a clear understanding of how backend systems work and how to manage user data safely and efficiently. 
#### Thank you.
