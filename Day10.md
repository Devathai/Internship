#### Day 10.
#### The day started by recalling about what happened yesterday. Remembering the details made it more interesting. There was a strong desire to learn more and understand things better. Curiosity grew, making it exciting to explore deeper.
#### The language is of symbols, tokens, expressions. Symbols are Alphabets, numbers, Special Characters. Tokens are collections of one or more symbols. Expressions are collection of tokens. But, the validity of the expression depends on two things Syntax and Semantics.
#### The Symbols are A - Z, a - z. 0 - 9, and special characters like !, @, ? & etc. Token has types, they are noun, pronoun, verb and adverb. Experssions are of exclamatory, statements, sentence. Group of expressions are paragraphs, sections, chapters. The compilation process is the process of converting human-readable source code into machine code that a computer can execute. Compiler works like the following 
1. Tokenizer
2. syntax analyzer
3. valid expressions
4. Machine level language
#### Tokenizer is a tool used to break down the sentence into smaller parts of tokens. It helps the computer to undertand the process by converting it into structured format that machine understands. Syntax analyzer ia used to analyze the syntax errors like . or, etc. Then semantic analyzer is used to see whether it is a valid expression or not. Valid expression means it has some meaning. Then using code generator it changes to Machine level language.
#### Then discussed about Compounding, the process of growing something over time by continously adding to it. He give a perfect example for compounding like credit cards and one simple problem.  similarly we should compound oru knowledge and skills. Knowledge and skill compounding is the process of continuously building on what you know and improving your abilities over time. Like compound interest, small daily improvements lead to significant long-term growth. The more you learn, the easier it becomes to acquire new knowledge. Skills sharpen through practice, and expertise deepens as concepts interconnect. Mastering one skill often enhances another, creating a multiplier effect. This applies to all fields—technology, business, arts, or personal development. Consistency and curiosity drive exponential progress. By actively applying and refining what you know, you unlock new opportunities and achieve higher levels of success.
#### I was filled with excitement and curiosity, eager to explore new ideas. The desire to learn more kept growing, making every discovery thrilling. Every new concept felt like unlocking a hidden treasure. I couldn’t wait to dive deeper, ask questions, and expand my understanding with every opportunity. I learned a new tool Figma. It is a user interface desgin tool, that is used for prototying and collabration. By using this tool we can pre- built a website to primarly show how the application runs, instead of completely developing a code. It helps developers to have a idea of how it could be done priorly. My mentor explained me about all the tools that are being used in figma and how to use it. Then gave a task to develop my favorite or interested application using figma. I started creating it. Then he asked me to create a few features that helps the users. 
1. Search by the date
2. Dedecting spam messages
3. Scheduled meaasges.
