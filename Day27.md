### Day 27.
#### Today I learned about Object fit in Tailwind CSS.  Object Fit is used to control the size of the image within their container. It determines how the image should be inside the container and maintaining its size too. It defines the whether the image should stretch, cover or fit inside the container. Tailwind provides the utility classes for the object fit.
1. Object cover – The image fills the entire container while maintaining its size. some parts of the image will be cropped if it does not fit inside the container exactly.
2. Object Contain – The entire image is visible inside the container without any cropping. If the size does not match, there will be empty spaces in the container.
3. Object -fill – The image will be stretched or squished to completely fill the container. It does not consider about the size of the elements.
4. Object- none – The image remains in its original size and will not consider to fit in the container. If it’s larger than the container, parts of the image might cropped.
#### Text overflow occurs when a long text doesn’t fill inside the container. It is used to prevent the text coming out of the container. It ensures that text stays within its container. Tailwind provides Utility classes to handle text flow.
1. Truncate – It adds an ellipsis when the text exceeds the available width. We need to set the width for the container. If the text exceeds the container hides and add … to it.
2. Text – ellipsis – It works similar to truncate, but we are explicitly styling. It need overflow hidden for a single line ellipsis.
3. Text – clip – It simply stops or cut the text at the edge of the container without showing the … in the container. It also requires overflow hidden to work this. It hides the overflow text completely.
#### Flexbox  is a layout system in CSS that is used to arrange the items inside a container. It is a utility class in tailwind CSS used to create flexible layouts. When we apply flex to a container, its children becomes flex items and we can control their positioning, spacing, and size easily. We use flex to make a container flexbox. Flex direction is used to control the direction in which the flex items are placed inside a flex container. By default, when we apply flex it will be arranged in horizontal row. We can change it by using flex – col, flex- row – reverse, flex – col – reverse
1. Flex – row – it arranges the item from left to right (default), while flex – row – reverse is used to reverse the order and the items flow from right to left.
2. Flex – col – it arranges the items vertically from top to bottom, and flex – col – reverse is used to make flow from bottom to top.
#### The justify-* classes is used determine how items are positioned along the main container (horizontal by default). For example, justify-start aligns items to the left, justify-center is used to center the items,  justify-end pushes them to the right, and justify-between distributes them evenly with space between them. 
#### Then learned about the how to peint the stars for rating for the websites like 3.5 star out of 5. I have fetched data from the API. In that I have a ratings in numbers and I shuld have the output as stars. I created full star, half star and empty star in Figma and exported as svg file. To use those file in angular I have to create assets folder in my angular application. Created a assets folder in my root folder in my angular application by using mkdir src/ assets command. Then moved my SVG file into the assets folder. Then we need to configure the assets folder in angular.json to access the SVG files. "assets": [ "src/assets" ] this will ensure that angular will correctly handle the files in the asset folder. 
#### First we need to create an array to hold the data from the interface and another one to store the values for rating. By using Subscribe() method to listen for emitted values from the observable. Then we get the received data to product[] and assigned to this.product. Then created a function as starClac  to calculate the stars. The starCalc (rates : number) takes the parameter rates as number which is representing the ratings.
```js
const star = Math.floor(rates); 
const halfStar = rates - star >= 0.5 ? 1 : 0;
 const emptyStar = 5 - star - halfStar; 
```
#### Math.floor(rates) is used to round the rating down to nearest integer. This gives number for full stars. For example, if the ratings is 4.5 the star value will be 4 by the math.floor. Then rate – star is to calculate the decimal part of the rating. If the decimal is greater than 0.5, a half star is added anf it is less no half star will be added. We have 5 stars for rating system, to calculate the empty stars, I have subtracted full star and half star from 5. I have found the solution how to find the number of full star, half star and empty star. 
#### Attended the afternoon session with Koushik anna. He displayed some questions and asked us to tell the output for that question. I helped me to understand more about accessing variables. In first question I was confused little bit but once I understood the problem it was easier. Then learned about typed parameter. It is parameter which has specific data types assigned to it. It parameter will only be passed to the function if it as a specified type of it. It is very useful because it has the clearly defined what type of data is passed to the function. Then also gave a small introduction about the synchronous and asynchronous with an example. The example gave me clear understand about it. Synchronous means tasks will be executed one after another. Like in a step by step manner. Each task must be completed before the next task. But in asynchronous, the task can run at the same time without waiting for each other to complete. For, Example we order food online, we wont be waiting at the door till the food comes we will be doing some other work in the mean time. 
#### Today, I learned about Tailwind CSS object-fit, text overflow, and Flexbox, implemented star ratings in Angular, get to know about typed parameters, and understood synchronous vs. asynchronous methods. It was a very productive day today and I gained some more knowledge that helped me improve my knowledge. 
#### Thank You.
