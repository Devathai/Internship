### Day 31.
#### Today I discussed about the issues I faced in the before task with my mentor, then I asked about the about the variable access. He told he is not sure about dart, but in JavaScript it will work based on the type we are using like let and var. When Koushik anna was teaching about this, I understood that the global variable can be accessed inside the inner function. So I written output as such that, but when I try to run the program it shows an error. So I have asked about it to my mentor and he told to look into Difference between let, var and const. Then told me about the structured way to write the code. I learned that If I write code it should be understand my everyone who reads the code. The naming should be descriptive of what purpose we are using the variables or functions. In JavaScript we use the naming convention, camelCase In this the words will be joined together and the subsequent word will be in capital letter. For example, firstName the second word name starts with capital letter. Instead of writing it using the underscore we use camelCase for readability and understanding.
#### Then I get to know about the message specification while committing in GitHub. Using specific keywords for commit message makes everyone understood that these all the update or fix that been done in that particular part. The commit message have what kind of change we are doing, where we are doing and why it is being done. The specific keywords are fix, feat, refactor and docs. The fix keyword will be used indicate a bug fix. Fix: the description about the fix. The feat keyword is used to indicate the new feature. Feat: the description about it. The refactoring indicates a code refactoring and docs indicate documentation changes. Then he told me about AI and how it will work and also discussed about how the it is done in Surfboard. Here they use for user query and he told me the difficulty in that the document. If the user is asking something like How to use this card, it is not giving the exact answer based on the documentation instead it is giving the answer based on the knowledge that’s trained or prior memory of the same question. So the document that we are giving should have the correct flow, there should be no duplication in that. Then he told me to look into AI how it works and how the response will be. 
#### I learned about the variables. I get to know about the term Temporal Dead zone. It is the time between entering the scope and declaring variable with let or const. During this time, the variable exists but cannot be accessed, and trying to do so will throw a Reference Error. 
```js
void main() {
  var x = 5;
 {
    print(x);     //  Error
    var x = 10;
  }
}
```
#### In the above function var x=5 is declared outside the block or scope. Then inside we print(x). then we re-declare the variable x = 10;. Here the first print X will throw an reference error even though we have the x in main function. If the variable is redeclared inside the block, it will check the variable inside that block only. So var x = 10 is after the print statement. So it throws an error as Local variable 'x' can't be referenced before it is declared. We can change the variable name like y=10 to run the code. First we should not have same variable name for two variable. In javascript, If we use let variable it will throw an reference error, but if we use var it will be undefined because var is a function scope and also Var allows redeclaration. 
#### Then I learned about how AI responds. For Example if I ask the AI, “tell me a story about lion”. AI breaks the sentence into small pieces as tokens such as tell, me, a, story and etc. It reads and understand the meaning, it uses the training data such as documents, books or sites. It thinks like what kind of thing we are asking for and what come after the given text. The model predicts the token by guessing the next word, based on the text we gave. It predicts as once , upon until the full response is done. Then AI puts all the tokens together into full sentence and send us back. 
#### Then I learned about vector space and how it used. A vector space is like a big 3D map where words, images, or ideas are turned into numbers and placed based on their meaning or similarity. A Vector Space Identifier usually refers to something that helps point to a specific vector inside a vector space. Then get to know about temperature. Temperature in an AI model controls how creative or random the AI how the answer should be. We can set the temperature to low and high. If the temperature is set to low we might get the random solution and might not be correct sometimes, If we set to high degree we get the creative and can get a unique answer back. 
#### Thnak you.
