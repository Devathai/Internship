### Day 29.
#### Today I learned about how to filter the text based on the input the user is giving.  First I created a service named newsApi service. I created a apiUrl and ApiKey to store the URL for fetching from server and to store the API for authentication. Then I injected Http Client to the constructor which allows us to make http requests. Created a function getNews () to fetch the API. We call the Http request using GET method. We send the Http get request to the NewsApi and fetches the data from that and returns as an Observable<any>, means the data will be sent asynchronously. 
#### Then I created a interface which represents the structure of the news article. Some fields are some  value and null so I declared it as content : string | null; Then in component I have a observable that holds the article[] received from the API. Article stores all news articles fetched from the API. Then Have an array as filtered article which stores the filtered list of articles based on the keyword and have a text = string ‘ ‘ ; that stores the user-input search keyword.
#### Then we need to create a method which get the observable from the API. The  getNews () method calls the newsApi service which returns an observable < article[] >. I subscribe to observable to get the data. Using ternary operator I checked the data whether it is in array or not and assigned it to both article and filtered article lists. Then I have another method to filter the data, so called the method from here to filter articles based on text. Created a if condition to check whether the keyword is there or not. If the keyword is empty then we resets filtered article to article which shows all the articles. We will be converting all the data and keyword to lower case to avoid the case sensitive issue. Then filters the article list by checking the title, description or content contains the given keyword or not. It updates the matching article to filtered article. We need to render this we create html code.
#### Created a container to have all the fields. Create a input field to give the user input. Inside the input field we should give the template reference variable that allows us to access the input fields value in the button click event. Then created a button with click event which correctly passes the input value when the button is clicked. Used for loop to iterate the array. Then using interpolation displayed all the elements. But I faced an issue here, It shows Can't bind to 'ngIfOf' since it isn't a known property of 'div' (used in the '_NewsApiComponent' component template). I used ngIf to display the user but I have given as async of users. It should be given like async of users. Then I rectified it. Then there was no error in that. 
#### We had a session with Gukesh anna. The session was about Investments. I learned about investing and how early to start investing, where to invest and many more terms. First investing is putting some money over some assets which returns us a profit or income from it. Then get to know about the difference in early investment and late investment. If someone if investing early had have 8% interest rate he will earn more and more profit after years. If started investing early the interest rate will be 3 times less than the early investor. Here what happens is that the amount we invest earn profit, then the earned amount will earn profit it will compound over years. So its advisable to invest early. 
#### Then learned about where all to invest amount. There are may ways to invest money. First is Fixed deposit, we can deposit the money in banks for a period and earn interest on that amount. But the should do they study to invest in the correct bank where we can get certain amount of interest.  Then he told about investing in gold and land. Both are a safe choice. Profit in gold and land works differently, but both are based on buying at a lower price and selling at a higher one. In the case of gold, you make a profit when you buy it at a lower rate and sell it when the price increases. Gold is often seen as a safe investment, especially during inflation or when the stock market is down, because its value tends to rise during those times. For land, the profit usually comes over a longer period. When you buy land, its value increases slowly as the area develops. Land takes time to grow in value, but it is considered one of the safest and most stable long-term investments. Then he told us about stock market. Many people believe that the stock market is just about looking at graphs or charts, guessing if the price will go up or down, and then buying or selling based on that. But in reality, the stock market is much more than just that. The real purpose of the stock market is to invest in companies. we need to understand what that company does, how it earns money, whether it’s growing, what its future looks like, who its competitors are, and so on. Many people who trade without proper knowledge end up losing money, because they don’t look into what company does and have not gained the complete knowledge of the company. Here we can get a quick profit not like land. Once I started earning, I should save some amount of money for emergency, and then should start investing and before that like anna said I should be able to understand what the company does and how they are making money. It was very knowledgeful day I have gained more knowledge in investments.
#### Thank you.
