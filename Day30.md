### Day 30.
#### In yesterday’s task, there was no error but the filtered product is not rendering in my local host, but when I console log I can see the response. Then I asked my mentor about it and he told to use signals to pass the values. I learned how to the filtered Article() changes when the value of signal change will be rendered in the site. I created a signal that holds an array of Article objects. Initially, it's set to an empty array. When the signal value is updated the UI will automatically updates it. After fetching the news data in getNews(), we are storing it in this.article. Then we update the signal with is data by using set(). filteredArticle now holds the complete list of articles. In getFilteredArticle(keyword: string), we are filtering based on the search keyword. If there's no keyword, you just reset filteredArticle to show all articles. If there is a keyword, we filter this.article manually and update the signal. 
```js
const result =this.article.filter ( ( articles ) => { 
return ( (articles?.title && articles.title.toLowerCase().includes(keyword) ) || 
( articles?.description && articles.description.toLowerCase().includes(keyword) ) ||
 ( articles?.content && articles.content.toLowerCase().includes( keyword) ) );
 }
) 
this.filteredArticle.set ( result );
```
#### We are updating the signal by .set ( result ), When the value of filtered Article() changes the UI will automatically updates the value. But still, I faced that issue, Then I console log the values that I stored in all arrays like article, filteredArticle and value observable. Only for value I got the response, but for article I got an empty array without values. Then I stored the fetched data into the articles. this.article = Array.isArray(data.articles) ? data.articles: []; and also check the article is in array format or not. Then I checked by typing the words that is in the response whether the filteredArticle works, It filtered the data by the keyword I typed. 
#### Then we had a session with Sree Ram, software developer in Surfboard payments. He taught about how the AI works and how effectively we can use it. I was very interested to know how the AI works and how it is delivering the answers to us. I get to know that AI works based on tokens. Before that I get to know that the AI will be trained with the tons of text. AI will read the text to learn the pattern in how people use language. 
#### Think token as a build blocks, we put them together to built something out of it. Similarly, Words, sentences, and paragraphs are like big LEGO creations. But before you build them, you need tiny pieces—and those pieces are called tokens. Tokens are like small pieces of text. When you type something into an AI, it doesn’t read it as full sentences or even full words — it breaks everything down into tiny parts called tokens. Let’s say I type Unbelievable. The model break down into tokens like unbelieve and able. Because it is easy for the AI to understand and generate text in smaller chunks rather than one big sentence. The LLM’s don’t see as the whole word, it will broke it into small parts, because they have been trained in that way. Everything will be broken into tokens before processing it. 
#### Then get to know about context limit or context window. Context limit is how much text or token an AI model can remember in a single conversation. It is like memory power of the AI. •  If the context limit is 4,000 tokens, the AI can look at the last 4,000 tokens (which is roughly ~3,000 words) of the conversation. If I give input over than 3000 words, it will forget the older parts like starting part of the conversation. Every AI agent has their own context limit. For example, ChatGPT-4 Turbo has a context limit of 128,000 tokens. Then learned about parameters, it is like the information or data that AI is learned during training, so it can guess the output. It is like tiny switch inside AI learned during training. If I ask the AI “What is the capital of India” It will break this into tokens and search for the similar parameter in it. It will select the most likely next word that comes after Capital of India and tell us the answer as New Delhi. 
#### Embeddings are a way for AI to turn words, ideas, or even whole sentences into numbers,  so it can understand and compare their meanings. AI do not understand words, it will only understand numbers. Each word, sentence, or idea is turned into a point in space using embeddings, like putting a pin on a map. Here space can have hundreds or thousands of dimensions. For example, It was raining today, the climate was very chill due to rain, I’m feeling down today, There the first two sentence is about raining and the next sentence is about feeling. So in this the first two have similar embedding and The third one, about feeling, would have an embedding far away from the first two, because it talks about something totally different.
#### Prompting is just how we talk to the language model. Prompting is how you tell the AI what you want. It is like giving AI a tsk, a question in text and the AI gives the best response on what we asked. It is like giving proper instruction to get the response we want from it. If I tell go that way and do it, it can understand, I should give the proper instruction like turn left and take the note from the rack will help the AI to give the best result. Also I get to know that If we add like “you are a you are an excellent AI model and an expert coder who has written a lot of code and helped developer” in top of the content which we are going to ask the AI, this will also make the AI work effectively on the other hand. 
#### A memory bank is like a notebook where AI saves important things you’ve said, so it can remember them later. Instead of starting fresh every time, it keeps useful info, like your name, favorites, or past chats. This helps the AI feel more helpful, friendly, and personal in future conversations. Today I have learned about AI and how it works and how can we make use of it effectively and more. After all it was a productive day.
#### Thank you.
