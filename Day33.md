### Day 33.
#### Today I learned about how the MCP server works. MCP stands for Model Context Protocol. It is a standardized protocol designed to facilitate this communication by providing a structured way to exchange context and data between AI models and their clients. MCP is like a universal plug for AI apps. For example we can take USB-C, it lets us easily connect our phone or laptop to all kinds of devices. Similarly MCP makes it easy for AI models to connect different tools and data. It makes it easier to build AI tools and agents. AI needs access to outside data to work well, MCP gives a ready made connections to any tools. Then learned about the workflow of MCP that follows client – server architecture. 
#### MCP server works by connecting different parts of your system, So AI tools can safely access the data they need. So programs like Claude desktop or some other AI acts as MCP hosts. Host are the ones that want to use the data. MCP client are like messengers that maintain one to one connection with the server. MCP servers are small programs that know how to talk to specific data through the standardized Model Context Protocol. These servers can connect to local Data sources like our computers files, databases and also to remote services like API through internet. This makes it easy and secure for AI to access the right data from our laptop or internet. So the AI will provide the answer from these tools rather than connecting to the available documents or sites. 
#### Then I learned how to create a MCP server with Claude desktop. First we need to download the claude for desktop based on our OS. We need to add filesystem MCP server, which communicates with data through the local file system. It will be similar for Claude for desktop, which support interacting with AI agents using the filesystem as the medium of communication. I have used node.js as filesystem MCP server. Then we need to configure the filesystem MCP server. In documents they have given that In Claude we have option edit config to do the configuration. But I don’t have that option. So I manually did the configuration I have open the claude desktop in my files and created a claude _ desktop _config.json. and modified the paths with full paths to directories so claude can access such as desktop and downloads folder. Then need to restart the claude, we will see the hammer like icon, means we have created a MCP server tool. I couldn’t see the hammer icon. So I asked AI to list the files on my desktop, If it runs Its configured but it shows an error as couldn’t see mcp lop files. 
#### Then I checked the version of claude. I have downloaded the latest version only and also checked whether by node.js version is above 16. Then run the MCP command to test the path is correct. The desktop path is not found. So I renamed the path and saved and tried it again, still not shown. Then I have checked the Config JSON file, it should be in JSON format not in text file. So I changed to JSON file. Now the MCP server is configured properly. Then I created a simple MCP weather server and connected it to host. To create that I gave created a folder as weather and created a index.ts that acts as a server here. I created a tsConfig.json and updated the package.json. Then created the MCP server and that provides two tools weather alerts and forecast using get-alerts and get-forecast. Then we should configure the server to claude. Given the path of the weather server in the list of arguments in claude config.json. that allows claude to automatically start our server when it’s needed. Here the claude acts as MCP client and weather server acts as MCP server that provides tools and tools are the API that our server exposes for claude to use. I couldn’t able to understand how the communication will be in the background. So I asked Sree Ram anna about it. He explained about how the MCP server works and how it communicates. 
#### I learned that the Claude generates a request based on the user requirement. It writes a request.json for weather server. The MCP server will be watching the folder for new files and reads from stdin. When the server sees the request.json, it parses the request and does it works and parses a response. Then the response file will be sent to the claude and it parses the response and it will give the answer for our question. All the request and response will be from stdio. The MCP server receives request as JSON via stdin (standard Input) and it sends response as JSON vis stdout (standard output ). The StdioServerTransport handles this. This listens to the stdin input and route it to the right tool such as get – alerts or get – forecast. Then the server writes the JSON response to stdout. Claude reads from the stdout directly. Then claude extracts the main content from the JSON and then renders the text from that content and use in the conversation. Then I get to know that the text the user gives the AI, will be converted into tokens and change that into embeddings and there will be filtering process. It will remove the words such as the. Was, is etc. it will take only the words that is used to get the exact answer. The filtering process will be done by several layers. Then it will search for next token next to it and fetches all at a time and gives us in the readable text or paragraph etc. 
#### Then we had a session with Koushik anna. He explained about error and exception handling. Errors is when something goes wrong that stops the whole working of the program. An exception is used to handle the error without stopping the working of program. To handle this we use try and catch. It is nothing but try this code, if there is a problem catch it and handle it without disturbing the whole program. For example, 10/0 will give an error. so we give this kind of code inside the try block and catch (error) the catch block catches the error message and print it and continues with the remaining part of the code. Then I learned about all kinds of errors.
1. Syntax error – The code incorrect code [ if(i==0{ ….. } ] it shows as syntax error.
2. Reference error – It will throw an error when we try to use a variable that hasn’t been declared.
3. Type error – It occurs when we given the wrong type of data.
4. 404 – Not found means that the resource does not exits
5. 401 – Unauthorized means that no or wrong authentication token.
Today I learned how MCP servers help AI tools like Claude connect to data safely using standard input and output. I also understood how errors and exceptions work in code, and how to handle them using try-catch blocks without crashing programs.
#### Thank You.
