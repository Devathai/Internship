### Day 39.
#### Today morning we had session with Gopi anna, a software developer in surfboard payments. The session was about Data and Database management. The first question that comes to our mind is What is data? Data refers to the information, but what is data in programming? Data is the information that the program uses to perform tasks. It can be numbers, texts, images, etc that is in “Digital Format”. 
#### Data management is process of collecting, storing and organizing the data in a manner so that it can be easily accessible. Array and list are like tools for data management, it helps for organizing and handling data inside the program. It is an index based data storage, But linked list are not index based they are node based one. It is helpful for storing data, organizing data in a specific order. Accessing, updating and removing particular item will become easier. It is not a complete data management system like database. It is a tools for data management within a program.
#### Then learned about data lifecycle. Collect data  organize data  store data  secure data  use data  Archive / delete data. First we collect the data, for example when someone fill a form or provide us some information. After collecting those data, we need to organize the data in a particular way, so it is easier for understand and we can work with updating or sorting like of processing data can be done. Then we need to stored the data safely in the database or cloud. Once it is stored we need to secure the data by protecting it with passwords or encryption, so only the person who knows and has the rights can access it. Whenever needed we use the data like we can use it programs to perform a function or to create a report etc. If the data is no needed for the project or might be useful in future we archive it. If its completely useless we can delete the data. Anna said the data should follow this cycle if not it can be considered as a data. 
#### Then get to know about the core principle and Fair principle. Core principle is like the rules to be followed to data, to make sure it is handled properly, safely. Data collection, we need to gather only the data what we need with consistent format like unique id, name to maintain consistency. Then Organisation, we should create a logical structure with clear naming. So it will easier to access and work with it. Name spacing in database it one of it. Clear names for columns, foe example firstname is little bit hard but if we give first_name it is good practice. Data storage, Databases cloud storage etc. we should select based on the requirement. FAIR principle is an acronym used in data management. It stands for findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable. Here the data should be easy to find, we should be able to access the data, data should work with other systems and Data should be ready to use again for different purposes.
#### Then learned about data protection, backup and security. Backup is very important in any industry. Data backup means making a copy of our data and saving it somewhere, so we can use it if anything goes wrong. We should always 3 copies one the original copy, then the copy in any external device and also one cloud storage like AWS and GCP. Then comes data security, Encryption is a way of protecting information by converting it into a secret code and it can be authorized only by people who knows that. For example, rearranging the alphabets or replacing the alphabets with other alphabet like if a is given it should consider as e etc. but later on this become easier for the third person to crack it easily. It has two types one is symmetric and another one is asymmetric. In symmetric same key is used to encrypt and decrypt, but the key need to shared between two persons very securely. Asymmetric uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. Only the user who knows the private key can encrypt the data. Another way to protect our data is hashing. 
#### Then learned about structured and unstructured data. Structured data is organized and easily searchable manner with tables, key, relationship between the tables etc. Unstructured data don’t have any defined structure to keep the data. It will be very difficult to search. Then learnt about database and its types. Database is a organized format for the collection of data so that will be easier to access, updated or retrieved. Then different types of database. RDBMS, NoSQL, In memory, NewSQL, Time server each one of these database server separate functionality. 
#### Then my mentor gave me a task to create a firebase and connect that the Todo task I have been working on. First he asked me to create an account in firebase. I created an account in firebase and created a project named Todo. Then installed the firebase in the project using npm install firebase @angular/fire. Then we need to add firebase config in our project. I learned about how to connect the database to store the information of the username and their todo list. First need to create a firebase.js file to set up the Admin SDK and we need to generate a service key token from firebase and save that in project. We need to import admin from firebase-admin. Then created a firestore using the admin.firestore() and initialized it to a variable db. Now using this db we can able to read, write and manage all the data from the firestore. 
#### Firebase is backend as a service platform, that is designed to simplify the app development and deployment. It is like a toolbox full of ready-made tools that helps to do all things for the app without having to built everything from the beginning. Fire store is like a database to store the data from our application like user details, etc. Fire store uses NoSQL, it won’t be having the tables and rows instead everything will be in documents based that are grouped together into collections. 
#### Then I was having error in the API that was not generating a token, So I went and asked Gopi anna and he showed what made the error. And I was bit confused about hashing in morning session and I also asked about it If we are hashing it be difficult for the third party to access our data. Because the hashed one will be not known to anyone. It is a one way function, once it is hashed we cannot decrypt it. For example I want to login I give my password. The system will has my hashed password stored. When I log in it will hash my input and compares the hashes. If it matches It will allows us. The hashed one will be very difficult to crack.
#### Thank you.
