### Day19.
#### Today l was given a task on HTTP post request. I need to create a new record in the database. I learned about HTTP headers. It is a key – value pair set along with an http request or response. It provides meta data about the request or response, such as authentication details, content type.  It is important to given headers while requesting because the server can understand in what format the data is coming and to store it. We give it in the content – type: specification , it tell the server or client that the data  is coming as such specification.
####  The JSON pipe in Angular converts an object into a JSON-formatted string for display in the template. It helps visualize complex data structures in a readable format. The HTTP POST method is used to create a new record in the database. To send a POST request, we create a function with the required parameters and store them in a variable. An observable is used to emit values. We also need to add the necessary headers and return the HTTP POST request along with the API URL and the data variable. Then, we create a method to assign values to the inputs we are posting. The observable helps store and display all records. The pipe() method processes the response, which is displayed using ngIf and the async pipe. The async pipe automatically subscribes and unsubscribes to the observable, making it easier to manage data in Angular templates. This ensures efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses without manually managing subscriptions.
#### Then I learned how to call the function when the button is clicked. We should create a button using <button>  and should use click event to call the required method. We should give the click inside the bracket (). If we give simple give click it will consider as a simple HTML attribute. (click) tells Angular that you want to listen to the click event and execute a specified method in your component. We should give like this <button class="button1" (click)="displayPost()">DisplayPost</button>.
#### We call the observable like this *ngIf="post | async as newUser". It checks if the post is there are not and async to the variable newUser for example. We use the variable to print each variable from the function. {{newUser.id}} is called interpolation. It is used in templates to display data from the component class in the HTML. 
#### Then had a session about lists, arrays and objects. Datatypes are of two types Primitive and complex datatype. Primitive datatypes are integer, string, Boolean and Complex datatypes are Arrays, objects, maps. Array is a collection of data that is ordered in list type and stored in a variable. We can access the elements by their index value. Objects are stored in a key – value pair. The key should be unique and we access them by the key. Also learned about, If we are assigning a variable to another variable how it will call the value. If I have a=10, b=a , here B will not be assigned to a new variable, it will indicated to the a’s address. If I have changed the value of a=20, here the new address will be created and store the value of a. If I have a list list1=[9,8,7,6] and list list2=list1, here both the list shares the same address. If I add a value to the list1 will add the value in the same address and 4 will be available for both list1 and list2. If we want to have a separate list of the list1 we use the spread operator, new address will be created along with varibales. The pass by value means, we are making a copy of that data and pass it to the function and it works with the copy of it. The pass by reference means, we are passing the address of the data or value and passing it to the function and it works with the reference value of it.  
#### I learned how to update the data in the API server using PUT method. First should create a function should give the unique value like id that we are using to get the particular data. And create a variable to store the data that is going to be updated. Added observable as it emits the data one by one and we should give the header as it tell the server about the data in which format is it. And return the api with the put method. return this.http.put<any>(`${this.myApi}/${id}`,updatedData); here the /${id} indicate that it should update the data where the id : 1 or anyother. In component class we call the service where the function for put method is declared and the function to update all the data by subscribing to that using pipe and map(). Similarly I learned to delete the record using DELETE method using http client from the server. As like update we should create a function give the variable to delete that record and return it. In component we call that function and give the value for that variable and delete that function by subscribing to it using pipe and map methods.  
#### Today’s session helped me understand how HTTP requests work in Angular, including POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I learned how to properly send data, update records, and delete them from a database. Understanding observables, async pipe, and header configurations is important for efficient data management in Angular applications. Additionally, learning about data types, memory allocation, pass-by-value and pass-by-reference helped me see how variables and lists behave in programming. These concepts are essential for handling data efficiently and ensuring that web applications function smoothly.
#### Thank you.
