### Day 41.
#### Today I have created a middleware for authentication. The function authenticationToken, which helps protect he todoroutes by checking if the user has a valid JWT Token. So, when the request is made, it looks for the token n authorization header. If the token is missing, it returns a 401 unauthorized error. If the token is present it tries to verifying it using a secret key that we have in the .env file. If the token is valid, it extracts the user’s email from the token and attaches it to the request object, so other functions can use that. If the token is invalid, send back a 403 Forbidden error. This function is used to ensure that only users with valid login token can access the todo routes. I have created a router for all the routes. To set the routes I need to impot Router from express. Then I set up the route for userAuth, it allows new user to signup using POST request and if the user is already existing user needs to login using the post request. Then I set up routes for handling the todo task, First I use the authenticationToken in the router to make sure that everyone is logged in the to access the any of the todo routes. I have created three routes one is for get all todos using the get request. Second one is to add a new todo using POST request and the last one is for deleting a todo by its id. 
#### Once I created the routes I have so many error but all were similar stating that No overload matches this call. (The last overload gave the following error. Argument of type '(req: Request, res: Response) => Promise<Response<any, Record<string, any>> | undefined>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Application<Record<string, any>>'. ) I have tired creating the interface for the Request in the authenticate token by extending the express request and given the user? {email:string} in the the authenticateToken function. Still I face the same issue for every routes. The error is there is a mismatch in types or how the functions is handled by the routes. I have given return response for every function like for login, signup, and todos. Then I asked anna about it and he explained that if you are using express we don’t need to return any response because while creating a function itself we use it as (req, res). So automatically the express itself will take the response back. Then I removed all the return keyword from the function. 
#### Once I run the function there were so many errors I have declared the index.d.ts which has the global types was inside another folder. So the functions couldn’t able to get that. The folder should in the root of the project folder. Then I moved the folder to the root. Then another error in middleware authentication token, the req.use will have the email extracted from the token. But I have extended the request and I added the custom request for the user. So I changed the request to custom request. Then I tested it postman to check all the routes is working or not. While trying the access the todo I have given the wrong token and it shows Unauthorized error. Only if I give the correct token I can able to access the todo functions. 
#### Then we had session with Abraham anna, Chief Technical Officer in Surfboard payment. We weren’t informed about the topic earlier, so we had no idea what we are going to learn today. He started the session by telling the topic himself, also he told that I will be difficult to grasp, also told us to try to catch up on it, if you are going out of it let us stop. The topic for the session is “potential”. What the company’s sees in the people are of two types. One is Do this person has potential and other one is Did they capable to use the potential in the environment. He will ask this question to mentors before hiring someone. Then he explained the concept in detail, we all possess a great potential.
#### However, this potential need to be used effectively. If we are in the wrong place or we didn’t use our potential, it will be waste. To understand this anna explained it with example of remote battery. There is a new battery kept it as covered, If we didn’t open the cover and didn’t use the battery it will be of no use. For example some might be interested in cricket or signing. If the person is used to sign in rock band and he is used to it. Suddenly if someone asked to sing in church, He might not be able to sing. But he knows how to sing, but he is in the wrong context or environment. one should change this approach or environment, by that they can use their potential effectively. Then he explained four point in axis format about the potential and environment. changeable, Unchangeable, intrinsic and extrinsic. Changeable and intrinsic means we can change the preference on thing, inside ourself. Unchangeable and extrinsic means cannot change anything, and extrinsic and changeable means work environment, or the context. He told that these points are very important, that tells us how a person can work effectively in the environment. only if the person is in the right context, he can be able to use his potential and work peacefully. So creating the right context is very important to utilize the potential we have and to grow in it. 
#### He told about the six key point that we should consider, before choosing the work or company. Money, Status and security, Work Life, growth and Development, work environment, purpose and challenges. He asked us to rate this out of 5 for the company Zoho. So whenever we look for a job at any company, we should do this rating foe the company accordingly. As a fresher and at this stage, we should focus on the growth and development, along with the purpose and challenges. While money is also important, but the priority changes with the different stages of life. 
#### Thank you
