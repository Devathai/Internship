Day 8.
Today was my 8th day as an intern. I have learned many new things during this experience, which were previously unknown to me. This opportunity helped me gain knowledge in coding, enhancing my understanding and skills. The information I acquired will be beneficial for my future growth and practical applications.
Day started with recalling about the topic computing, then moved to algorithms. An Algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a task. We asked to form a team and given a task. The task is to give instruction to a machine to play a dart game by enacting. I have no idea about dart game and rules. I thought that we should give instruction to a machine about all the rules and how my players etc, but we were asked to give a basic instruction to do the task. We discussed as a team about solving it. While discussing as a team we came up with more idea. Playing as a team gave us more ideas through sharing different opinions. It helped us understand the topic better and made solving the problem easier with teamwork and cooperation. Then They played a video about the instructions. The instructions mast be clear, then only the machine can able to give us the correct solution. 
I met my mentor, he asked about the topics that he told me to learn. I have learnt about the variables and I didn’t able to understand the topic in angular. I learned about how the angular works, but I haven’t done it practically. So he gave me a task. The task is to create new component and need to pass the data between them. The process is done by input and output function. To create a new component, the syntax is ng generate component component name. The short term for this is ng g c component name. here we use two functions @input and @output. 
i)	@ Input allows a parent component to pass data to the child component
ii)	@output sends data back to parent class.
While doing this task I faced a issue the child component is unknown. I try to solve it by searching it, but I could able to figure it out. I asked him about the error. He explained me how to clear the error. The parent class didn’t know the child component exit. So, we have to give a path to the child component in routing. I learned how to create component and pass the data between them. Then had a nice lunch and came back to learning.
He explained me about the asynchronous function and what it does, the key concept we must know. I learned about synchronous and asynchronous function. Synchronous functions follow a sequential execution, meaning each line of code is executed one by one, and the program waits for the current task to complete before moving to the next. On the other hand, asynchronous functions allow the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a time-consuming operation to finish. Asynchronous programming is commonly implemented using callbacks, promises, or the async/await syntax. The setTimeOut and SetTimeInterval functions used to execute code after a specific amount of time, but they serve different purposes.
The setTimeout() function is used to execute a function once after a specified delay (in milliseconds). setInterval() repeatedly executes a function at fixed time intervals until it is manually stopped using clearInterval(). A promise method help us to handle asynchronous function. It has two states resolve reject. The resolve function used to return a successful task completion. The reject function is called when the task is failed. Promises wait for something to finish without stopping the whole program.
We had a seminar on the topic "Security Attacks", where we learned about various online threats that can harm our personal information. The speaker explained common attacks like phishing, where fake emails or messages trick people into sharing sensitive information, and shoulder surfing, where someone secretly watches your screen or keypad to steal passwords. He also talked about fake updates and fake emails used to spread viruses. To avoid these attacks, we were advised to avoid clicking on unknown links, use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and stay alert while using devices in public places. 
After finishing the session, I learnt about async and await functions. The async keyword is used to declare a function that always returns a Promise. The await keyword is used inside async functions to wait for a Promise to complete before moving to the next line of code. The await key is valid only inside the async function.
