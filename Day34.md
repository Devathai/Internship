### Day 34.
#### Today I learned about the Node.js server and the work flow of the Node.js server.  Node.js is a program that can listen to request and sends something back (data ,json ). It listens for the request processes it and then send back the response. The architecture or work flow have several layers and the request and response will be through all the layer based on the request is given.
#### The entry point is the main file that starts our server. For example, index.js or main.ts . This will be first file that node runs when the app starts. Its will be defined in the package.json. Then comes application configuration. It is part of application where we define API keys, Database URLS and environmental variables. The best to put configuration is to use .env files for sensitive and secret information. 
#### Routing Layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP request like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and will be directed to the right handler. It is responsible for the endpoints and call the functions that process the request, so that it can read the request and send back the response. Controller layer contains the logics that actual code handles what should happen when a request comes in. It comes after the routing layer. When a route is given, the controller layer receives the request and processes data and send the response back to the client. It is responsible for Handling HTTP request, Apply logics like some calculations and decisions, it also interact with the database or API’s.  
#### Service layer is where we keep all the complex logics and data accessing operating sepertaed from the controller. It handles how all these to be done controller handle what need to done. It is responsible for interacting with database, calling API’s poecessing or transforming data. Simply controller handle request and response and what it should do, all the complex logics, calucations and data handling goes into the service layer. Data Access layer is used to talk directly to the database like MySQL, MongoDB, etc. It handles how the data is fetched, created, updated or deleted. Data layer goes to the database to get the data. 
#### Middleware is a function that run before we route and sends a response. It can log data, check if the user is logged in, validate input, authentication, modify request or response object and error handling. When comes to error handling we can have a centralized error handling strategy which is a single place in our app to catch and handle all errors – instead of using try and catch multiple times everywhere. If the error is thrown it will show up to the global error handling middle ware and it decides how to respond to the client. 
#### For example we take user registration, client send the post request to /api/request with the user details. The server receives the request and express router checks if it exits. It routes the request to the function that actually do the work. The controller layer extracts the name, email and password from the request and passes these data to the service layer and waits for the response, it can success or failure. Then service validate the input by calling the data access layer. If the user is valid, it hashes the password, calls the data access layer to save the new users data. If there is an error, it will throw an error as “it already exists “. Data access layer talks to the database and it searches for an existing email, inserts the new user if all is good. Returns the result back to the service layer. 
#### We had a session with Koushik anna. I learned about the keywords such as const, final and static. Const is used to indicate that a variable or other entity is a fixed value that cannot be changed after the initialization. It make sure that the value remains the same throughout the program and also in execution. We use const keyword when the value is 100 % fixed and known during the compilation. For example, const pi = 3.14159; it will be constant in complete program and in compilation also [compile time constant]. It cannot be reassigned.  
#### The final keyword is used to assign a value once and then it is locked , but the value can be decided at runtime. Use final keyword when the value does not change after it’s set but it might change only be at runtime (eg. Time or API response). Static keyword is used to indicate that a member belong to that class rather than a specific instance of it. For example the company name will be same for all employees, but each employee has their own id and name. So company name will be static through out the code. We no need instance to call the static variable, the is common to all and defined in class level. 
#### Then learned about inheritance. It means a child class gets everything from a parent class like behaviours and properties. We use extends keyword to inherit the properties from parent class to child class. For example, user login to teachers. All the teaches will be having id, name, email we inherit all the properties and the child class can use all those and can have their properties such as years of experience, salary, dept. Here we don’t need to write the id, name everything for every user. 
#### Today was a productive day. I learned about how a Node.js server works, its layers, and the full request-response flow. I also understood key concepts like const, final, and static, and how inheritance works in programming.
#### Thank You.
