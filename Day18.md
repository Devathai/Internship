#### Day 18.
#### Today I started with recalling about the observables and how to fetch it. Why are we using observables while http request than promises. I get to know the difference between them. A promise cannot handle a stream of data. It resolves as soon as we get the 1st chunk of data. It returns a single value. A promise will return a data even if no other code is using that data. But In observable, it keeps fetching all the data streams one by one and return the values. Observable will return a data only if some code is using that data.
#### Then I learned about some of ng directives as ngFor and ngOf. ngFor is a directive that iterates over a collection of data like an array, list, etc and creates an HTML element for each of the items from an HTML element. It really helps to reduce the space and reduce the lines of code as well. Instead of writing separate code for each element to get print. It is used to repeat a portion of HTML template once per each item for an iterate list. It is structural list as it manipulates in a structured way. It manipulates the Document Object Model by adding or removing elements. 
#### The ngIf directive in Angular is used to show or hide elements based on a condition. If the condition is true, the element is added to the page; if false, it is removed completely, not just hidden. This helps improve performance because Angular frees up memory by removing unused elements. You can also use ngIf with else to display different content when the condition is false. Additionally, the as keyword lets you store the condition’s value in a local variable, making your code easier to read. This directive is useful for controlling what appears on the screen dynamically. 
#### We need to add * in front of the directives as it is a structural directive and a short hand of writing it for [ngIf] inside the ng-template. Instead we can write *ngIf. It makes easier to write and understand the code.  I had a doubt on the task, anna told me to use @for and @if but I couldn’t able to do that I thought It doesn’t supported in my version. So I updated the angular version in my system. But even though I couldn’t. I asked Ashini akka about it. She told me to check whether you have imported common module in the components that you are using. I have checked it still I couldn’t. Then I also updated my node.js version.  While updating I face some issues. I get to know how to fix that with the help of google. Once I install the node.js and checked whether it is installed or not. If it shows like node.exe it means it is installed but the path for that is not given. Then I set the path and successfully updated it. Even though I couldn’t able to use @if and @for in my application. So Priya akka told to use ng directives instead of using that. 
#### I learned about how to fetch only the required for small portion of the data’s from the API. While doing http request we should use slice or filter method to fetch the portion that is required. Slice is used to create a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array and then transform them.  Takes two arguments: start index and end index. It will only fetch the data with the index from 0 to 10. Filter is used to allow you to first filter emitted values based on a condition and then transform them. 
#### Then I went to afternoon session and were recalled about the functions and classes. Function have a function name, parameters, body and a return type it returns a value or else void. Then class has properties and methods. In simpler Class has something and does something. The if, else, and else if statements are used to make decisions in programming. The if statement checks a condition, and if it is true, the code inside it runs. If the condition is false, the else statement runs instead. Similarly the else if statement is used when there are multiple conditions to check. If the first if condition is false, the program checks the else if condition. If that is also false, the else block runs. A for loop is used in programming to iterate over a block of code multiple times. It runs a set of instructions repeatedly until a condition is met. The loop starts with an initial value, checks a condition, and iterates by increasing or decreasing the value in each step. This helps in repetitive tasks, like printing numbers or going through a list of items. For example, a for loop can iterate through an array to process each item one by one. It makes coding easier by reducing the need to write the same instructions multiple times. Array is used to store a list of item. It has index value starting from zero. Object is used to store the data in a key value pair. Array can be called as objects because it has key as index value and values as list of data. 
#### Today, I learned many useful and productive things. I gained new knowledge that will help me in my work and daily life. It was a great day of learning, and I feel gained new knowledge. Learning new things always makes me better and more prepared for the future.
#### Thnak you.
